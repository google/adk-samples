"""The fact-anchoring rule, held to real accept/reject decisions.

This is the skill's only ground truth about what the user will actually post:
20 drafted comments on google/adk-samples#2373, 16 posted and 4 cut.

The rule itself is a judgement an agent applies. What CAN be tested is the
`fact_anchor_lint` heuristic that approximates it — so if someone loosens the lint,
or the rule drifts, these fail instead of the skill quietly getting worse.

The fixture is small and the rule was fitted to it, so a perfect score here is
expected rather than impressive. Its value is as a *ratchet*: it can only get worse
silently if someone edits the fixture too.
