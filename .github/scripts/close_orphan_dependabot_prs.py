Close orphaned Dependabot PRs.

Scans the recipe tree for dependency manifests to build the set of live
(ecosystem, directory) pairs, lists every open Dependabot PR, and closes any
whose head-ref maps to a pair that is NOT in that set. This catches PRs
stranded when a recipe is removed or renamed — Dependabot itself does not
close such PRs, so without this cleanup they linger indefinitely.

Where the live set comes from
-----------------------------
The tree, via recipe_manifests.scan() — NOT .github/dependabot.yml.

This script used to recover the set by regex-scanning enumerated `directory:`
keys out of dependabot.yml. Reading that file is now actively worse than it
sounds. It does list every recipe ecosystem, so a glance suggests the data is
right there — but those entries exist only to suppress updates and carry
`directories: ["/", "**/*"]`. A parser would recover a glob and no concrete
recipe pair, judge every open Dependabot PR an orphan, and close them all
with --delete-branch.

The tree is also the more accurate source. Which recipe directories exist is
a property of the tree, not of a config file that never enumerated them —
and the 98 PRs open when the policy changed are precisely the ones that
would be swept up if this ever started reading dependabot.yml again.

Uses `gh pr close <n> --delete-branch` with no explanatory comment: the GitHub
GraphQL `addComment` mutation has an anti-abuse throttle that trips on large
batches (observed in practice at ~80 comments in a burst). The close+delete-
branch itself is the audit signal; the workflow log below enumerates every
closed PR.

Invoked by .github/workflows/dependabot-housekeeping.yml.

Requires: `gh` on PATH, GITHUB_TOKEN in the environment.

Safety
------
Two guards, because the operation is destructive and not easily undone:

  - Refuses to run at all if the manifest scan comes back empty, which would
    make every open Dependabot PR look orphaned.
  - Refuses to close a batch larger than --max-close (default
    DEFAULT_MAX_CLOSE). Routine cleanup strands a handful of PRs; a large
    batch means something reclassified healthy ones, and wants a human.

Usage
-----
  python .github/scripts/close_orphan_dependabot_prs.py             # apply
  python .github/scripts/close_orphan_dependabot_prs.py --dry-run   # list

# earlier version of this comment asserted the opposite — that security
# updates open one PR per package. That was true when written and is not
# now, so do not restore it.
#
# The single-segment rule is still dropped here, because grouping is a
# repository setting rather than a guarantee: with it off, or for an
# ecosystem it does not cover, an ungrouped security PR names one package,
# and that is where a slash-bearing identifier shows up.

    For most ecosystems the tail after the directory prefix must be a single
