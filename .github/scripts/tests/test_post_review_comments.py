"""Unit tests for post_review_comments.py.

This script decides where an automated review comment lands. Its failure
modes are quiet ones: an anchor computed one line off puts a comment on
innocent code, and a mis-parsed file header drops every finding in a file
while reporting only "not a line this PR adds". Neither shows up as a red
check — the review just says something wrong, or says nothing.

Every test below pins one of those.
