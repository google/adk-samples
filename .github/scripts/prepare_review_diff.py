"""
Trim a PR diff to what is worth reviewing, and size the review from it.

Used by .github/workflows/_ai-pr-review-core.yml, between fetching the diff
and building the reviewer's prompt.

Two jobs, both of which exist because the reviewer's prompt has a hard byte
budget (Linux caps one argv string at 131072 bytes, so the workflow allows
125000 and truncates the diff to fit).

1. DROP WHAT NOBODY REVIEWS. A regenerated `uv.lock` is thousands of lines
   that no reviewer reads and that no comment can usefully land on, and every
   one of those lines displaces a line of hand-written code from the prompt.
   On a PR that mixes the two, the lockfile wins purely by being longer, and
   the code it was generated from never reaches the model at all.

2. SIZE THE REVIEW. The reviewer was previously told nothing about how many
   findings a PR of this size should yield, and settled at one or two
   regardless. The budget below is computed from REVIEWABLE churn, so a PR
   that is 1400 lines of lockfile plus 80 lines of code is sized as the small
   PR it is.

Both numbers are deterministic, which is the point: a model asked to judge
its own thoroughness will not, and a model asked to ignore a lockfile it can
see in its context still spends attention on it.

Usage:
  python3 prepare_review_diff.py \
    --diff pr_diff.txt \
    --out pr_diff_reviewable.txt \
    --github-output "${GITHUB_OUTPUT}"

Outputs (to --github-output, or stdout when it is absent):
  reviewable        `false` when nothing is left to review
  reviewable_lines  added+removed lines across the kept files
  budget            comments expected from ONE lane
  kept_files        files surviving the filter
  skipped_files     files dropped, with a one-word reason in the log

Exit codes:
  0  filtered diff written (even when it is empty — `reviewable=false` says so)
  2  CI fault — the diff this workflow just fetched could not be read

# ------------------------------------------------------- fitting the budget
#
# The prompt has a hard byte budget (agy takes it as one argv string, and
# Linux caps that at 131072). Until this existed the workflow met the budget
# with `head -c`, which cuts at a byte offset in git's own order -- roughly
# alphabetical. That is not a review policy, it is an accident, and on PR
# #2626 it produced this: 662KB of diff, ~100KB of budget, and the budget went
# to the six paths that sorted first. Four of the six were markdown. Not one
# of the fourteen source files was reviewed in full, 31 files were invisible,
# and the author was told to split the PR up.
#
# So pack the budget deliberately instead:
#
#   1. SOURCE before tests before prose. A defect in shipped code costs more
#      than one in a test, which costs more than one in documentation, and
#      when there is not room for everything that ranking is the decision.
#   2. Smallest first WITHIN a tier, which maximises how many files are seen
#      whole. One 79KB file would otherwise take four fifths of the budget.
#   3. Whole files, with at most one partial at the end. A 2.7KB slice of a
#      74KB file is not a review of anything -- an equal split across 37 files
#      sounds fairer and tells the model nothing about any of them.
#
# Reordering is safe: a hunk header carries its own line numbers, so an anchor
# does not depend on where its file sits in the diff.
