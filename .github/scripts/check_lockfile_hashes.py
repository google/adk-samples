Checks that every wheel and sdist distribution in a uv.lock file has a hash

Usage: python check_lockfile_hashes.py <path-to-uv.lock>

Exit codes:
  0  all distributions have valid hashes
  1  contributor-fixable problems found; every one has been reported with
     a fix, both as a human block and as a ::error annotation
  2  CI fault — the checker crashed or was invoked wrongly. Never blamed
