"""
Drive the issue lifecycle for .github/workflows/recipe-canary.yml.

Reads the canary's per-job results and decides, for each recipe, what to do
about its tracking issue: open one, nudge it, escalate it, or close it.

The lifecycle, advanced ONE RUNG PER FAILING RUN
------------------------------------------------
    run 1   open an issue, notify the recipe's owner
    run 2   reminder comment
    run 3   the recipe should be marked `status: inactive`
    run 4   warn that deletion is scheduled
    run 5   propose deleting the recipe, tagging a maintainer
    passing close the issue

On the monthly cron that is roughly a month per rung, so about four months
from the first failure to a deletion proposal. The ladder can stretch — a
missed or delayed run costs a rung, which is the safe direction — but it can
never compress, so an owner always gets four separate notices before deletion
is proposed. See the comment on LADDER for why an age-in-days gate did not
survive contact with a monthly cron.

The issue carries the state deliberately: no new manifest field, no
archaeology over git history to work out when something started failing, and
a rung that cannot fire twice because the label recording it is right there
on the issue.

Why "ask" and not "do"
----------------------
Three rungs want to change files on `main`, which is protected: 1 approving
review AND a code-owner review. A workflow authenticating with GITHUB_TOKEN
cannot push there, and its approvals do not count toward either requirement —
that is exactly why 98 Dependabot PRs sat unmergeable for months.

So this script does not write to the repository at all. It has no YAML
library, opens no pull request, and the `report` job that runs it is declared
`contents: read`. Every file change the ladder calls for is left to a human,
said plainly on the issue. That is a real limitation, not a temporary one to
paper over: an earlier version promised "a pull request will be opened
automatically" whenever a CANARY_APP_TOKEN secret was set, and since no code
ever opened one, setting that secret would have made the canary lie on a
public issue.

Building the write side means a comment-preserving YAML editor (these
manifests are mostly comments), an identity that can push, and its own
review — tracked separately.

Notifying the owner
-------------------
`manifest.ownership.poc` is the source of truth, but only 3 of 12 declared
owners can actually be ASSIGNED — the rest have no repo access, and GitHub
silently drops an invalid assignee, creating the issue unassigned with no
error. So the @-mention in the body is the real delivery mechanism and
assignment is a bonus applied only when it will work.
