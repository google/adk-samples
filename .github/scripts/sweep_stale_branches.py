"""
Delete stale branches from the GitHub remote.

Classifies every branch in the repository against three independent clocks
(configured under `stale_policy.branches` in .github/policy.yml) and deletes
the ones that have run out. Invoked by
.github/workflows/stale-branch-sweep.yml.

Why ancestry is not enough to detect a merge
--------------------------------------------
This repository is squash-merge only — `allow_squash_merge` is the sole
enabled merge method. A squash merge replays the branch as ONE NEW COMMIT on
the default branch, so the branch head never becomes an ancestor of `main`.

`git branch --merged main` therefore reports almost nothing here: at the time
this was written it found 1 merged branch out of 28, while 6 more had a
merged pull request. Trusting ancestry alone would have misfiled all six as
unmerged orphans — provably merged work, judged under the one clock that can
destroy unrecoverable work.

So `classify` consults the PULL REQUEST state first and only falls back to
ancestry, which now only catches the rare branch merged with no PR at all.

Safety
------
Deleting a branch cannot be undone from the UI, so:

  - Branches that are the head or base of an OPEN pull request, the default
    branch, anything carrying a GitHub branch-protection rule, and anything
    matching `stale_policy.branches.protected` are never touched.
  - The run refuses to act if the open-PR query comes back empty, since an
    API hiccup returning `[]` would unprotect every branch at once. Override
    with --allow-no-open-prs when the repository genuinely has none.
  - A batch larger than --max-delete is refused outright.
  - Every deletion logs the branch's SHA. A deleted branch is restorable via
    `POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/git/refs` given its name and SHA, so the run
    log and job summary together are a complete undo record.

Usage
-----
  python .github/scripts/sweep_stale_branches.py             # apply
  python .github/scripts/sweep_stale_branches.py --dry-run   # report only
  python .github/scripts/sweep_stale_branches.py --max-delete 40
