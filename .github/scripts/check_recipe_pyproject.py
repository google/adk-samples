"""
Validates a recipe's pyproject.toml against the repo's metadata rules.

Rules enforced (see .github/workflows/python-validate-recipe.yml):

  - project-name-matches-folder: [project].name must equal the recipe's
    expected name, which depends on the root the recipe lives under:
      * core/ and contrib/ — the folder basename (e.g. core/python/
        deep-search -> "deep-search").
      * skills/ — "<vertical>-<solution>", because skills/ interposes a
        mandatory vertical namespace (skills/<vertical>/<solution>) and the
        basename alone is not unique across verticals. See
        expected_project_name() for the full rationale.
  - python-version-floor: [project].requires-python must ACCEPT Python
    3.11 exactly — it must neither permit anything below (loose floor) nor
    exclude 3.11 by requiring higher (e.g. `>=3.12`). CI pins Python 3.11
    and any recipe that can't lock under 3.11 breaks the lockfile check.
  - description-matches-manifest: if [project].description is set, it must
    equal manifest.description from the recipe's manifest.yaml (after
    .strip(), exact match). Optional; skipped when absent.
  - default-pypi-index: [[tool.uv.index]] must have an entry with
    default=true whose url is public PyPI (https://pypi.org/simple[/]).
    Required so `uv sync` works on Google corp workstations without
    Airlock auth (see the block comment in the root pyproject.toml for
    the full rationale).

Note: no-local-ruff-config (forbid [tool.ruff*] blocks in recipe
pyproject.toml) is enforced by a grep in the workflow itself, not here.

MAINTENANCE NOTE — keep in sync with the align skill. These four rules are
also implemented (as auto-fixes) by
.agents/skills/align-recipe-pyproject/scripts/align_pyproject.py. This script
only READS/validates (stdlib tomllib + pyyaml); that one REWRITES
(comment-preserving tomlkit + ruamel.yaml). They are intentionally separate
but MUST stay semantically in sync — if you change a rule's meaning here,
mirror it there (and vice versa).

Usage: python check_recipe_pyproject.py <recipe-dir>

Exit codes:
  0  every rule passed
  1  contributor-fixable problems found; every one has been reported with
     a fix, both as a human block and as a ::error annotation
  2  CI fault — the checker crashed, or its own environment is missing a
     dependency it needs. Never blamed on the contributor's files.

A missing pyproject.toml is not this script's failure to report (a separate
required-files check owns it), so that case exits 0 with a note.

    For most recipes this is just the folder basename. For a recipe under a

       `skills/grocery/product-search` would both be forced to declare
       [project].name = "product-search" — two distribution packages with the
       same name. The vertical exists precisely to namespace solutions, so the

    2. It matches the skill's own identity. A vertical skill's SKILL.md

       use "<vertical>-<solution>"; the Python distribution name should not be

    Two failure modes:

      * ``permits_older`` — spec accepts a Python below MIN_PYTHON (e.g.
        ``>=3.10``, ``~=3.10``, ``!=3.11``, ``<=3.12``, unpinned).
      * ``excludes_min`` — spec rejects MIN_PYTHON by requiring higher
        (e.g. ``>=3.12``, ``>=3.12,<3.14``, ``~=3.12``). This used to be
        permitted under a "floor is 3.11 but higher is fine" reading, but
        it makes CI fail with a confusing "lockfile is out of date" error
        whose real cause is that uv can't resolve a 3.11 interpreter
