"""Customer-service coordinator with a billing sub-agent, guarded.

Two agents, one plugin. `DelegationGuardPlugin` is registered once on the
`App`; from then on every agent in the tree carries a permission set, and
every tool call is checked against it before the tool body runs.

The coordinator can issue a refund. The billing agent it transfers to
cannot: it is delegated `billing.read` and nothing else, so its
`issue_refund` call is refused at the callback, and the function is never
entered. The refusal is appended to a hash-chained ledger that verifies
without this process, this recipe, or any network.

# them; they call `build_app()` with their own model, so importing this
# module stays side-effect-free for them.
#
# One caveat worth knowing: a CLI run builds once, on first access, so
# every session `adk web` serves shares that root Guard and its ledger,
# and the time-to-live starts counting then. That is fine for trying the
# recipe out. For anything where one caller's decisions should not be
# another's evidence, call `build_app()` per run.
