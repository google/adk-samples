"""The permission model for this recipe — written by hand, on purpose.

attenu-guard does not decide what a task needs. You declare three
things and it enforces them:

1. `COORDINATOR` — what the root agent holds.
2. `DELEGATIONS`  — what each sub-agent may *request*. The child receives
   the meet of the request and the parent, so a request can only ever
   shrink the child, never widen it.
3. `TOOLS`        — the scope, and the quantities the ceilings are
   measured against, that each tool call needs.

An agent missing from `DELEGATIONS` gets nothing. A tool missing from
`TOOLS` is checked against a scope no authority grants. Both fail closed.
