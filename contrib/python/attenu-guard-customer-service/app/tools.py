"""The recipe's tools, over a small in-memory order book.

Every tool appends to `EXECUTED` as its first statement. That list is
how the demo and the tests show that a refused call was refused *before*
its body ran, rather than run and then reported. Nothing else in the
recipe depends on it; delete it when you adapt this to your own tools.

Two layers, not one: `attenu-guard` decides whether an agent may call a
tool at all, and under which ceilings (`app/permissions.py`) — that
check runs at the ADK callback, before a tool body is ever entered. It
does not, and should not, know what a valid `amount_cents` is or which
address is the right one for a given invoice; that is ordinary
input validation, and it belongs here, inside the tool body, the same
as it would in a tool with no delegation guard at all. Every value
below is something the model chose, so every one of them is untrusted
whether or not the caller was authorized to place the call.
