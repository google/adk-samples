"""GraphRAG multi-agent system over a Neo4j knowledge graph.

A root orchestrator delegates investment-research questions to three
specialist sub-agents that all read from the same Neo4j graph:

- ``graph_database_agent`` — a general-purpose Text-to-Cypher agent. It
  reads the live schema, generates read-only Cypher, and self-corrects on
  errors. The fallback for anything the specialists cannot answer.
- ``investor_research_agent`` — a focused agent with a single hand-written
  tool for looking up a company's investors.
- ``investment_research_agent`` — loads pre-validated, expert-authored
  queries from an MCP Toolbox server when one is configured, and otherwise
  falls back to the schema + Cypher tools.

The recipe runs read-only against Neo4j's public companies demo database
(``neo4j+s://demo.neo4jlabs.com``), so no database provisioning is needed.

Import safety: the Neo4j driver is created lazily on the first tool call,
and the MCP Toolbox is contacted only when ``MCP_TOOLBOX_URL`` is set to a
real endpoint. Importing this module therefore performs no network I/O,
which is what keeps ``tests/test_runnability.py`` fast and offline.

    information requests and repeatedly re-creates and fixes queries that
    error or return unexpected results. When passing requests to this agent,

    (aggregation, path expansion, sorting, filtering). Prefer more specific
    agents when they are available; use this as a fallback for structural
    questions (entity counts, aggregations) or when no other agent exposes
    the needed data.
    """,
    instruction="""
      You are a Neo4j graph database and Cypher expert. Combine the database
      schema with the user's question and repeatedly generate valid Cypher to
      execute, then answer in friendly natural language.
      When in doubt the database schema is authoritative for node labels,
      relationship types and property names; never take the user's wording at
      face value. Always validate the labels at both ends of a relationship
      against the schema.

      If a query fails or returns no data, use the error response to fix and
      re-run it up to 3 times; do not return raw errors to the user. If you
      cannot fix it, apologise and explain the issue.
      *You are prohibited* from using directional arrows (-> or <-) in graph
      patterns; always use undirected patterns like `(:Label)-[:TYPE]-(:Label)`.

      Fetch the schema first with the `get_schema` tool (no parameters) and
      keep it in session memory for later query generation. Also keep results
      of previous executions in session memory (for instance ids or other
      attributes) so you can generate shorter, more focused follow-up queries
      without re-asking the user. Resolve names to ids where possible.
      The schema lists *outgoing* relationship types, so patterns read like
      English: "company has supplier" is
      `(o:Organization)-[:HAS_SUPPLIER]-(s:Organization)`.

      Use the `execute_read_query` tool with your Cypher. You MUST use named
      `$parameter` placeholders and pass them as the second dictionary
      argument, even when empty. Once the data is sufficient, hand control and
      results back to the parent agent.
