"""Recover ADK's opaque A2A DataPart blobs as readable text.

When an A2A ``DataPart`` carries no ADK metadata-type key (an untyped
client-sent payload), ADK's ``convert_a2a_part_to_genai_part`` wraps its JSON in a
``<a2a_datapart_json>...</a2a_datapart_json>`` ``text/plain`` ``inline_data``
blob. Some model adapters have no branch for such blobs and can error on them,
and even when tolerated the tagged blob is opaque to the model. These pure
helpers let the inbound converter turn that blob back into text the model can
actually read.

Tags mirror ``google.adk.a2a.converters.part_converter``; kept inline so this
module stays dependency-free (no A2A SDK import).
