"""Every registry model id must actually resolve at Vertex.

``gemini-3.1-pro`` sat in the registry from the Gemini-only migration until it
was found by hand: the real id is ``gemini-3.1-pro-preview``, and every unit
test that named the model asserted on strings or token limits without ever
dispatching, so nothing failed. Selecting it via /model or delegate returned
404 at runtime.
