"""
Entry point for all recipe validation tools.

Usage:
  uv run validate [subcommand] [scope]

Both arguments are optional:

  subcommand  — which check(s) to run; one of: manifest, structure, readme, all
                (default: all)
  scope       — what to validate; one of:
                  all            (default) validate core/ and contrib/
                  core           validate core/ only
                  contrib        validate contrib/ only
                  core/<recipe>  validate a single recipe directory

When only one argument is given and it looks like a path (contains '/') or
is a known root ('core', 'contrib'), it is treated as the scope and all
checks are run.

Examples:
  uv run validate core/rag-agent-search    # run all checks on one recipe
  uv run validate core                     # run all checks on core/ only
  uv run validate manifest                 # run manifest check on everything
  uv run validate manifest core            # run manifest check on core/ only
  uv run validate structure                # run structural check on everything
  uv run validate structure core/rag-agent-search
  uv run validate readme                   # run README check on everything
  uv run validate readme core/python/rag-agent-search

Exit codes:
  0 — all checks passed
  1 — one or more checks failed
